Review each of the suggested privacy best practices outlined in this module. Give each suggestion two scores, one based on the strength of the privacy (on a scale from 1–5) that it would provide and the other score (on a scale from A–F) of how likely you would be to follow this suggestion and why or why not. Then ask three of your friends to likewise score these suggestions. Finally, design at least three additional privacy best practices of your own. Write a one-page paper on what you have learned.
