# Survey
“Do you know what location services are?” 


- “What is a MAID?” 


- “Are you aware of surveillance-based advertisers?” 


- “Does your school monitor your actions and how do they use that information?”

When I went around and survyed my friends, some of them knew location services were while some didn't. 
Majority of the peole didn't know any of the other options besides a few who knew the first and last question.
