# About me 
My name is Spencer Ashby and my interstes in cybersecurity is finding out the flaws and figuring out how to fix it. During my time in high school, I went to Columbus downtown Highschool and learned more about IT. During my time there I got a job where I help teachers all across Columbus city schools rest there passwords. While I was there I learend a bunch of behinde the scenes on what actually happens. Before I got the job at Kingswood Data center, my teacher taugh the class how to fix Chromebooks. My goal in cybersecuirty is to learn more what my trade school had taught me.
