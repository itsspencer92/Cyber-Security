# Notes:
-----
- Early netowrks didn't use interconnecting deviceus, instead they were connected in daisy-chain fanshion by lengths of cable.

- Multiport repater is just a repeater with several ports to which you can connect cabing.
  - Most multiport repaters have at least four ports, some have 24 or more.

- A hub performs the same function as a repeater but with more outging ports to which bit signals are repated.
    - Most hubs have inicator lights for power which are link status netowrk activity and collisions. Each port has a link status indicator which glows green.
    - Uplinking is making a connection between devices such as two switches.

- Netowrk bandwith is the amount of data that can be transferred on a netowrk during a specifi interval.

 - Netowrk switches are like hubs, which they are used to interconnect mutiplie computers so they can communicate wtih one another.
    (A switch loooks like a hub)

- When a device can send data and receive data simultaneously, itâ€™s called full-duplex mode.
