# Week 1 - Introduction to Security Awareness 

**Description:**  
We went over Cisco module 1. Then we were told on how to make a Github account, as well with SAGE for chatgpt 

**Artifacts:**  


**Reflection:**  
Cybersecurity is important because somebody steals your personal information, then they could take all the money from your bank account, steal your identity, order credit cards under your name or other things like that. 
If a hacker steals your identity it can take months or years to fix and it could cost you thousands of dollars. When a hacker hacks into a workplace such as a bank or any business they can steal more than one users information. 
They can steal thousands of people personal  information instead.

One challenge in preventing attacks is that people can be easily tricked by clicking links in their email thinking its safe. 
What the link really does is steals your passwords and usernames for that website or websites. 
Hackers are always coming up with new ways to steal personal information it's nearly impossible to be aware of them all. 




 **Case Project 1-1: Personal Attack Experiences**
I have personally feel for those fake free hacks for Minecraft when I was younger. But I figured out how to remove that file from the computer. 
It happened maybe when I was 8 and I wanted to have the better advantage to people, as well as show my friends what I did. 
It was a Torjan virus and I looked at the recent downloads and had task manager open to see why the fans where spinning so fast and found it that way. 
The computer was fine afterwards. What could've prevented it was me not falling for those types of scams. I think it was succesful, I did my best to remove the files from the computer.
