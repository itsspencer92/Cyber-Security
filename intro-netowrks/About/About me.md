# About me 
My name is Spencer Ashby and I have been always intrested working on computers. How I got into computers was when I watched the Matrix when I was younger and how the main character was a hacker. During high school, I went into a trading schoool program at Columbus Downtown Highschool and that's when I learned on how to fix chromebooks and deksptop computers from my teacher. During the summer I got a interenship at Kingswood and worked all across Columbus city schools, helping teachers reset their passwords that they have forgotten or if they had any issues with their devices.
